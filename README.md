# Software-Defined-Wireless-Sensor-Network -


"We have built a software-defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN) platform to control the sensor nodes in a centralized manner. The platform consists of two components - sensor nodes and SDN controller. The SDN controller defines control policies to be deployed at the sensor nodes. Accordingly, the sensor nodes act in the network. Thus, we have a better network management, while leveraging the global view of the network through the concept of SDN."   

• Implemented multitasking of sensor nodes, uploading of sensed data to the server in real time and on demand by the user.  

• Bi-directional communication between client and the sensor nodes, Flow table implementation in all the sensor nodes.  

• Real time Destination change, Enabled Packet Drop or Forwarding activities to bypass a particular access point or discard the data of a particular node and also implemented Unicaste and Broadcaste mode for all the commands/activities.
